# This code implements a summarization and questioning model using Streamlit, PyPDF2, OpenAI embeddings, and LangChain libraries.
# It allows users to upload a PDF file, extract text from it, and then input additional text for analysis. Users can also input a query
# to get answers from the analyzed text. The code utilizes functions for text summarization and question answering, and displays the
# results using Streamlit interface.
